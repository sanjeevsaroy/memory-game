## Introduction

Welcome to the Memory Game repository! The game was a project from the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity, implemented by yours truely.

## Getting started

To get started, first download the repository, open `index.html` and the game will load, ready for you to play!

## How To Play

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. It's very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched. Be aware - the amount of moves you make and how long your game is will be tracked, and you'll also be rated!

## FAQ

**Can I start again?** -
Of course you can! If you're in the middle of a game, click the restart button at the top right of the screen, or if you've finished a game, then click the 'Play Again' button.

**What happens if I win?** - Press 'Play Again' and try to beat the stats you get! Maybe you'll match all the cards faster and in less moves ;)

**So you're saying there's no prize?** - Now now, I never said that, but now you've brought it up, i'll be honest - there are no prizes.

**Then what's the point of playing?** - Because the game is great fun! You like to have fun, right?

**Yeah that's true. I mean i'm just an FAQ heading but we too have feelings.** - Wow... did my FAQ section just become self-aware?

**You're not the first person this has happened to! You must have a lot of questions, so head over to my FAQ page.** - You mean this [one](#faq)?
